Development of a portable force plate for the analysis of ground reaction force
in beach sports

1. Introduction
There appears to be a growing popularity for beach sports like beach volleyball, -soccer,
-handball and footvolley. In those sports, athletes are faced with different surface conditions (1,
2). Especially dry uncompacted sand has high absorptive qualities which result in a decrease in
the force returned from the muscles (3). Thus, it has been shown that there are significant
differences in spike jump movement in beach volleyball compared to volleyball. These
differences appear in the maximum jump height, the velocity of the centre of mass, the
countermovement, the angular amplitudes of the lower limbs and other kinematic parameters
(4, 5, 1). However, optimal force production either vertically in beach volleyball or horizontally
in beach handball is essential for competitive success. To predict and measure the performance
of an athlete in this quality a vertical jump test is needed (4–7, 2). Currently, this is tested
primarily on solid ground on indoor force plates as this is the ‘gold standard’ for measuring
jumping performance (8, 9), but not in the sand. It is argued that the jump height on solid ground
is in direct correlation with the jump height in the sand (4), but this is not shown for ground
reaction forces or kinematics of the lower limbs, which are important determinants for jump
performance (4, 5). There are other devices used, such as the yardstick jumping device (4, 10),
“My Jump” application (8), jump and reach test (7), motion capturing systems (11, 12) or
accelerometry (13), which have their downsides as they can only test static jumps, like squat
jump or countermovement jump, and do not provide information about the force development.
Some studies developed custom measurement devices by building sandboxes placed on a force
plate, which are reported to be heavy (120 kg), stationary, used for a single study and only
conduct static jumps (5, 14, 7, 11).

As it is shown, there is a solution missing to measure sport-specific jumps in the sand and
provide essential information about force development of the lower extremities. Therefore, the
task was to develop a portable force plate apparatus, which can provide important data to
athletes and coaches about the jump performance of beach sports athletes.

2. Methods
Important for the validity, reliability and comparability of the measurements are the physical
properties of the sand. These include the moisture content, relative density (compaction rate),
grain size distribution and stiffness (5, 15, 13). To determine these, a moisture meter and a
penetrometer (16) are necessary. The FIVB and IHF also provide requirements about the grain
size distribution (17–19). For the horizontal and vertical ground reaction forces a piezoelectric
force plate is used.

3. Results and discussion
The device is dimensioned by 60 x 60 x 40 cm. It provides a shovel for digging a hole in the
court and a stick for stirring the sand inside the box. The apparatus includes a piezoelectric
force plate at the bottom of the device, which can be covered with sand, a moisture sensor for
measuring the moisture content of the sand and a penetrometer for determining the compaction
rate and density. The validity, reliability and comparability of the force curves have to be tested
in field situations. Nevertheless, this device can provide more insight into the biomechanics and
kinematics of jump performance for athletes, coaches and future research on this topic.
